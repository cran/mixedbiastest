\title{mixedbiastest: Bias Diagnostics for Linear Mixed Models}
\description{
The `mixedbiastest` package provides a function to perform bias diagnostics on linear mixed models fitted with `lmer` from the `lme4` package. It implements permutation tests for assessing the bias of fixed effects, as described in Karl and Zimmerman (2021).
}
\section{Functions}{

\describe{
  \item{\code{\link{mixedbiastest}}}{Performs the bias diagnostic test.}
  \item{\code{\link{print.mixedbiastest}}}{Prints the results of the bias diagnostic.}
  \item{\code{\link{plot.mixedbiastest}}}{Plots the permutation distributions and observed test statistics for each fixed effect.}
  \item{\code{\link{list_fixed_effects}}}{ List Fixed Effects from an lmerMod Object.}

Development of this package was assisted by GPT o1-preview, which helped in constructing the structure of much of the code and the roxygen documentation. The code is based on the R code provided by Karl and Zimmerman (2020).
